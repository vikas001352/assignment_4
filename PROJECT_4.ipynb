    "Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, it becomes a specific instance that adheres to the class's structure and behavior. Objects can have their own unique data, but they share the same behavior as defined by the class.\n",

    "1=Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called a class. The class acts as a protective container, and the internal details are hidden from the outside world. This allows data to be accessed and manipulated only through the defined methods, ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
    "2=Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable units. In OOP, abstraction allows you to create abstract classes or interfaces that provide a blueprint for subclasses. Abstract classes contain abstract methods that define the interface without providing an implementation. Subclasses must implement these abstract methods, allowing for polymorphism and code reuse.\n",
    "3=Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). It establishes a parent-child relationship between classes, where the subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass. Inheritance promotes code reusability, as subclasses can extend and modify the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of a class to take on multiple forms or to exhibit multiple behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (when a subclass provides a specific implementation for an inherited method) and method overloading (when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Polymorphism enables more flexible and generic coding practices, enhancing the flexibility of the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you call a method on an object, Python automatically passes the reference to the object as the first argument to the method. This reference is then assigned to the self parameter, allowing the method to access and manipulate the object's attributes and methods.\n",
